Market Opportunity\n- Based on this conversation, it's difficult to identify a clear problem to solve.

This can be mitigated by adjusting the approach to be more user-friendly and less intrusive.\n- Priority should be given to building rapport and trust with the user, as this will likely enhance their willingness to share in future interactions."
