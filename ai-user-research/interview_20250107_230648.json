      "question": "\"Tell me about a typical day in your role as a Sales representative, what kind of challenges do you frequently encounter?\"",
      "response": "\"My typical day revolves around managing about 30-40 active prospects, starting with prospecting calls in the morning and handling demo meetings throughout the day. The biggest challenge is juggling multiple deals at different stages while maintaining detailed follow-up with each prospect, especially when urgent requests come in from prospects who are close to making a decision but need immediate responses to their technical or pricing questions.\""

    {
      "question": "\"Can you walk me through a recent deal that was particularly difficult to close, and what made it challenging for you?\"",
      "response": "\"I recently had a complex deal with a healthcare company where their procurement process required approvals from five different departments, each with unique concerns about our software's security features. I managed the challenge by creating detailed documentation addressing each department's specific requirements, coordinating multiple technical review sessions between our security team and their IT stakeholders, and maintaining constant communication to keep the approval process moving. Despite the deal taking twice our normal sales cycle, we successfully closed it by demonstrating how our solution met all their compliance requirements.\""

      "question": "\"Tell me about a time when you lost a potential client. What factors do you think contributed to this and how did it affect your workflow?\"",
      "response": "\"Last quarter, I lost a promising client to a competitor because I didn't identify all key decision-makers early enough in the process. When their CTO unexpectedly joined the final review meeting, they raised security concerns I hadn't previously addressed, and while I tried to bring in our technical team to respond, the delay caused them to choose a competitor who had already built rapport with their technical team. This experience made me adjust my discovery process to always map out all stakeholders during initial conversations.\""
