  "analysis": "1. Key Findings\n    - The sales leader is not directly involved in the day-to-day selling process.\n        - Evidence: The participant repeatedly mentioned, \"I am a senior sales leader and don't do day-to-day selling.\"\n    - The questions asked are not relevant to the participant's current role and responsibilities.\n        - Evidence: The participant stated, \"Questions are not relevant.\"\n    - There is a gap in understanding the sales process from a leadership perspective.\n        - Evidence: The participant did not provide any details about the sales process or its challenges.\n\n2. Market Opportunity\n    - Problem worth solving: Developing a more comprehensive understanding of the roles and challenges in a sales team, not just the salesperson role.\n    - Estimated market size and potential: The solution would be beneficial for all businesses with sales teams, a significant global market.\n    - Existing solutions and their limitations: Current user research methods may not adequately address or understand the specific roles and challenges within a sales team.\n\n3. Action Items\n    - Develop a set of interview questions specifically designed for sales leaders.\n        - Expected Outcome: Gain insights into the sales process from a leadership perspective.\n    - Conduct additional interviews with salespeople to complement the information obtained from sales leaders.\n        - Expected Outcome: A more comprehensive understanding of the sales process.\n    - Analyze and compare the responses of sales leaders and salespeople.\n        - Expected Outcome: Identification of common and unique challenges and strategies within the sales team.\n\n4. Recommendations\n    - Consider developing separate user research strategies for different roles within a sales team.\n        - Potential Risks: May require more resources and time. Mitigation: Prioritize based on the size and structure of the sales team.\n    - Recommend implementing training programs tailored to the unique challenges faced by different roles within the sales team.\n        - Potential Risks: Resistance to change. Mitigation: Communicate the benefits and provide support during the transition.\n    - Prioritize developing a better understanding of the sales leader role, as this was identified as a significant gap in the initial interview."
