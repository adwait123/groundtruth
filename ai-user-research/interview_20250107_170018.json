      "question": "\"Can you walk me through a typical day in your role as a salesperson, highlighting any challenges you regularly encounter?\"",
      "response": "\"Most of my day involves connecting with potential clients through cold calls and follow-up meetings, with my biggest challenge being reaching key decision-makers in larger companies. I typically juggle between 20-30 active leads at different stages of the sales pipeline, while also managing urgent requests from existing clients who need quick solutions or have questions about our product updates.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "\"Tell me about the last time a deal didn't go through, what happened and how you handled it?\"",
      "response": "\"Last month, I lost a promising deal when a client chose a competitor's solution because of their lower pricing, despite our product having better features. I handled it professionally by asking for detailed feedback about their decision, which revealed that budget constraints were their primary concern, and I've since worked with our team to create more flexible pricing tiers that could help win similar situations in the future.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "\"Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a particularly difficult customer. What was the situation and how did you navigate it?\"",
      "response": "\"Recently, I had a customer who was extremely frustrated about our platform's downtime during their critical business hours. I listened carefully to their concerns, acknowledged the impact on their business, and immediately escalated the issue to our technical team for priority resolution. I also provided hourly updates on the progress and offered them two months of service credit, which not only resolved their immediate frustration but actually strengthened our relationship as they appreciated the transparent communication and quick response.\""

    {
      "question": "\"Walk me through the process of how you prepare for a sales meeting, including any tools or resources you use, and any challenges you encounter along the way.\"",
      "response": "\"My sales meeting preparation starts with thorough research about the prospect's company using LinkedIn, their website, and recent news articles to understand their business challenges and potential pain points. I create a customized presentation focusing on how our solution addresses their specific needs, and I also prepare responses to common objections by reviewing similar deals in our CRM, though the biggest challenge is often getting accurate budget information before the meeting to properly tailor our pricing discussion.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "\"Tell me about the most recent sale you made, can you walk me through the process from initial contact to closing the deal and any obstacles you faced along the way?\"",
      "response": "\"I recently closed a deal with a mid-sized tech company that started from a LinkedIn connection where their IT director commented on our product feature update. The main obstacle came midway through negotiations when their procurement team raised concerns about our data security protocols, but I arranged a technical deep-dive session between their security team and our CTO, which addressed their concerns. The entire process took six weeks from initial contact to signing, and what made it successful was maintaining constant communication and quickly bringing in the right technical experts when needed.\""
