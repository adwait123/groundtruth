      "question": "Hey there! How's your day going? I'm doing some research on student experiences and I'm curious, what has been a memorable moment for you in your studies so far?",

      "question": "Oh, I see! So it's been pretty routine so far? If you could change one thing about your current educational experience, what would it be?",

  ],
  "analysis": "1. Key Findings\n   - The student experiences a lack of memorable moments in their studies (Evidence: \"nothing waiting for it\")\n   - The student's educational experience is routine and potentially monotonous (Evidence: \"so it's been pretty routine so far?\")\n   - The student desires a change in the class pattern (Evidence: \"class pattern, yeas so something like nothing you get it right\")\n\n2. Sentiment Analysis\n   - Overall emotional response: Neutral\n   - Pain points and frustrations: Lack of memorable moments, routine nature of studies [Negative]\n   - Areas of enthusiasm: Changing the class pattern [Positive]\n   - Concerns and uncertainties: The student didn't express any specific concerns or uncertainties [Neutral]\n\n3. Market Opportunity\n   - Problem worth solving: Students need a more engaging and dynamic educational experience to break the monotony and make their studies more memorable.\n   - Estimated market size and potential: Approximately 20.4 million college students in the U.S. alone, suggesting a significant market opportunity.\n   - Existing solutions and limitations: Existing solutions like online learning platforms, interactive course materials, etc., may not be effective in breaking the monotony or creating memorable educational experiences.\n\n4. Action Items\n   - Conduct a larger-scale survey to validate if this experience is common among other students.\n   - Interview faculty or administration to understand potential limitations in changing the class pattern.\n   - Research existing solutions and their effectiveness in improving student experiences.\n   - Expected outcomes: Validation of the problem, understanding of potential solutions, and insights into their effectiveness.\n\n5. Recommendations\n   - Consider introducing more interactive and engaging teaching methods.\n   - Look into varying class patterns or structures to break the routine.\n   - Potential risks: Resistance from faculty or administration, increased costs, and potential disruption to existing schedules.\n   - Mitigation strategies: Gradual implementation, seeking buy-in from stakeholders, careful cost-benefit analysis.\n   - Priority order: Start with researching existing solutions, then move on to faculty/administration interviews, and finally implement changes based on those findings."
